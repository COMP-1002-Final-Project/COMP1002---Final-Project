                    <p class="about-paragraph-1">Outpost is a board game wherein you compete with other
                        players to build the best outpost that you can. Published between 1991 to 1994 by TimJim
                        Games, the game is intended for 3 to 8 players, has an estimated playtime of 1.5 - 3
                        hours, and is recommended for ages 12+.</p>

                    <p class="about-paragraph-2">The game has three phrases, with different improvements available
                        during different phases. Improvements are purchased through auctions, and each improvement
                        offers unique advantages, such as improved technologies, better resource storage, and increased
                        population limits.</p>

                    <p class="about-paragraph-3">
                        Each improvement is worth points, and each staffed factory is also worth points. The player who
                        reaches 75 points first wins.</p>
