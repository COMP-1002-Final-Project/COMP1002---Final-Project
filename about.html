                            players to build the best outpost that you can. Published between 1991 to 1994 by TimJim
                            Games, the game is intended for three to eight players, has an estimated playtime of between
                            one and a half to three hours, and is recommended for ages 12+.</p>

                        <p>The game has three phrases, with different improvements available during
                            different phases. Improvements are purchased through auctions, and each improvement is worth
                            points. Each improvement offers unique advantages, such as improved
                            technologies, better options for storing resources, increased population limits
                            for resource-producing factories, and so forth. Each staffed factory is also worth points.
                            The player who reaches 75 points first wins.</p>
